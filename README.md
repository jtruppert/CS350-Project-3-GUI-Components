Hi, I'm a second-year student at the University of Alabama studying computer science and this is repository is to house the code from my third CS350 project from Fall 2015.

Assignment description can be found here: http://cs350.cs.ua.edu/F2015/Projects/P3.htm

Directory: CSample - defines a survey sample, MainWindow - defines main window where you can add, modify, and remove collected survey samples, DialogBox - launches the dialog where survey data is entered

I hope this helps someone, somewhere, so let me know if you have any questions.
